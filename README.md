# SideScroller Camera Plugin for UE4
SideScroller Camera Plugin for Unreal Engine 4

Note that this plugin is still in a very early stage and in heavy developement.

Things in place:
* Camera starting settings (Follow or static, initial camera arm length, initial camera rotation, interpolation speed, z-axis offset)
* Follow one or more Actors with camera
* First Settings are updated when overlapping with viable Actors with SSCOverlapComponent
* Basic manual camera movement


Furthermore planned things for v0.1 release:
* Update camera settings when actors with FollowComponent overlapping with viable Actors with OverlapComponent
* Integrate Multiplayer including one Screen and Splitscreen
* Option for ignoring axis movement of actors (e.g. for ignore jumping)
* Integrate x,y,z-Axis limitations (e.g. for hidden rooms or level-endings)
* Replace SSCGameMode with SSCSystemManager for delegating Events so you can use this Plugin with every Gamemode
* Establish naming conventions for c++ files
* Implement automated Testing
* Create a Wiki
* Update the plugin to the newest UE4-version
* Clean up most of the code and add comments
* Add Spline-based camera movement
* Clean up and order public variables on components

Ongoing: Update Example Map and Wiki with implemented features
